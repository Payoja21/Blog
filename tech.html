        <h4>1. Intelligent Process Automation</h4>
        <p>
            In the latest technology trend, organisations are looking for intelligent automation tools to solve business challenges and increase productivity, efficiency, and accuracy, benefiting the organisation. One of the successive waves, Intelligent Process Automation, or IPA, brings together Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to empower rapid end-to-end business process automation and accelerate digital transformation. In RPA, computer software 'robots' handle repetitive, rule-based digital tasks which are driven by structured data. However, many business processes now are fed by or generate large amounts of unstructured and real-time data. IPA makes it possible to automate processes with machine learning and analytic capabilities and cognitive technologies, like computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and fuzzy logic.</p>
        <h4>2. A Shift Toward Cybersecurity </h4>
        <p>With data becoming more precious than ever before, there's no shortage of cyber criminals out there looking for new ways to compromise it. One of the downsides of novice-level AI is that hackers can manipulate them to access the sensitive information. So, a significant trend in AI is developing technology to recognise and report common types of attacks. Anti-virus software is also being developed by using AI in the same manner as this technology can help prevent a malware threat from having devastating consequences. When it comes to businesses, AI-powered cybersecurity tools also can gather data from a company's own communications networks, digital activity, transactional systems, and websites, as well as other external public sources. These tools then run algorithms to identify patterns and detect or predict threatening activity, potential data breaches, etc. This is a trend we can expect to continuously see in the future as criminals constantly create new malware and data acquisition methods.

        <h4>3. AI for Personalised Services
        </h4>
        <p>As AI becomes more powerful and efficient at researching a particular market and demographic, acquiring consumer data is becoming more accessible than ever. The biggest AI trend in marketing is the increasing focus on providing personalised services. One of the most common ways that AI can do so is through analysing the online activity of individuals who search for specific keywords. This level of personalisation is virtually guaranteed to provide a better experience for customers, which will directly increase the revenue of companies that take advantage of it. As machine learning becomes more adept at understanding what people want in specific instances, AI will become less of a sales tool and more of a digital friend.</p>
        <h4>4. Automated AI Development
        </h4>
        <p>In coming years, expect to see significant innovations in the area of 'AI for AI': using AI to help automate the steps and processes involved in the life cycle of creating, deploying, managing, and operating AI models. At a certain level, AI can develop its algorithms to solve problems, increase efficiency, and provide humans with useful research data.

            Using automated AI will allow even non-experts to use AI algorithms and techniques. One example is Google's AutoML, a tool that simplifies creating machine learning models and makes the technology accessible to a wider audience. These tools can create as much customisation as required without knowing the complex workflow of Machine Learning in detail. Although this type of development is in infancy, automated AI is renowned for growing exponentially and is a major AI trend.
            
            </p>
        <h4>5. AI in Healthcare
        </h4>
        <p>The contributions that AI can import to the healthcare industry are working in groundbreaking ways, allowing people worldwide to receive safer and more efficient care and making it easier to detect, prevent, and cure diseases. Also, AI's ability to acquire data in real-time from electronic health records, emergency department admissions, equipment utilisation, staffing levels, etc. – and to interpret and analyse it in meaningful ways enables a wide range of efficiency and care-enhancing capabilities in hospital administration. Drug discoveries are another field where AI is acerbating.

            AI is playing an essential role in helping healthcare professionals respond to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. AI is being used to distinguish COVID patients and essential hot spots. COVID vaccine drug discovery is being repurposed and speeded up using AI techniques. Researchers have developed AI-based thermal cameras and smartphone apps for estimating the temperature of people and assembling data for healthcare organisations. Intelligent robots are being deployed to implement "contactless delivery" for isolated individuals, helping medical staff ensure that the key areas stay disinfected and safe for use.
